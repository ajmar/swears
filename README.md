# Swear word list

This simple Node project generates a plain swear words list file (swears.txt) that can easily be matched against.

### Instructions:

Use swears.txt, or, to generate it again:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ajmar/swears.git
npm i
node index.js
```

The swear word lists are sourced from:
